Confession. 

Lonely in an empty room,
I confess 
to nobody.

Life can be hard. 
But I can't take in a single breath without you. 

Love can be hard.
But I can't live a single moment without you. 

Listen, will you?
For my heart is begging me to speak. 

Love me, will you?
For my soul is wilting away from your embrace. 

Listless, I lie here,
reminiscing your caressing touch,
your calming lullaby.

Am I imagining?
Your warmth wraps my body like a thick blanket. 

It awakes all my senses.
I close my eyes in bliss. 

This must be love,
I whisper. 

Nonexistent, and yet
so real.
